# Class-Shape-Transformation-method
An airfoil parametric method

> * There are two test airfoil data in this repository.
> * The defaut case is NACA0012. The optional one is RAE2822. 
> * If you want to change to the other testing case, just changing the filename to "RAE2822.dat"(line 155 in CST.py) and the leading edge radius(line 159 in CST.py) which you can get from Profili software. 

Here are two example results:

>* NACA0012 CST fitting result, control points(n=6) in each surface.

>* RAE2822 CST fitting result, control points(n=6) in each surface.
